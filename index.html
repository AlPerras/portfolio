        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Alexandre Perras</strong>, an aspiring entrepreneur and engineer with a passion for innovation and
            problem-solving.
            Currently based in Australia, I'm exploring the intersection of technology, creativity, and business. I enjoy
            tackling
            diverse projects that range from mechatronics and AI-powered applications to sustainable solutions and
            consumer-focused
            brands.</p>
        
        <p>I'm currently studying <em>The Odin Project</em> to sharpen my coding skills and build a strong foundation for web
            development.
            My long-term goal is to create impactful products, from a self-solving Rubik's cube to a flying bike, while also
            growing
            my brand in the ready-to-drink cocktail space.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not brainstorming ideas or coding, I'm dreaming up ways to design smarter devices, exploring engineering
            programs, or enjoying life by the water (maybe even dreaming of my first catamaran!). My journey is all about
            blending
            my creative drive with technical expertise to build a career—and a company—I'm proud of.</p>
        
        <p><em>Let's connect and make something amazing together!</em></p>
