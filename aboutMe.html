    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Alexandre Perras</strong>, an aspiring entrepreneur and engineer with a passion for innovation and problem-solving.
    Currently based in Australia, I'm exploring the intersection of technology, creativity, and business. I enjoy tackling
    diverse projects that range from mechatronics and AI-powered applications to sustainable solutions and consumer-focused
    brands.</p>
    
    <p>I'm currently studying <em>The Odin Project</em> to sharpen my coding skills and build a strong foundation for web development.
    My long-term goal is to create impactful products, from a self-solving Rubik's cube to a flying bike, while also growing
    my brand in the ready-to-drink cocktail space.</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not brainstorming ideas or coding, I'm dreaming up ways to design smarter devices, exploring engineering
    programs, or enjoying life by the water (maybe even dreaming of my first catamaran!). My journey is all about blending
    my creative drive with technical expertise to build a career—and a company—I'm proud of.</p>

    <p><em>Let's connect and make something amazing together!</em></p>
